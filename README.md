# COMP4334-PGP-Project

This project is designed to facilitate secure email transmission using PGP encryption. It provides a simple setup for sending encrypted emails between users. The implementation is based on Java and can be run using IntelliJ IDEA.

# Getting Started:
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Navigate to the src/main/java directory.

3. Run the Server.java file to start the server.

4. Run Alice.java from the src/main/java/Alice directory to launch Alice's user interface.

5. Run Bob.java from the src/main/java/Bob directory to launch Bob's user interface.

# Usage
-After launching Alice and Bob interfaces, you'll see input boxes.

-In the first input box, enter the receiver's name.

-In the second input box, enter the email text content you want to send.

-Click the "Send" button to initiate the encrypted email transmission.

# Note
-Ensure that the server is running before attempting to send emails.

-The PGP encryption ensures secure communication between Alice and Bob.

-Make sure to provide valid receiver names and email content for successful transmission.
